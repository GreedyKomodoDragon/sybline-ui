# Sybline Management UI

This is a management UI for the Sybline Message broker. It is very much in an pre-alpha state, is not ready for building and using in production.

This is because the UI is missing many features and the Sybline Message broker has not yet published its rest API/is missing many of the features in the rest API that are currently in the GRPC.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
